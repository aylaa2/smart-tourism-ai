# Tartus

Tartus is a coastal city and port on the Mediterranean Sea. It is Syria's second-largest port and an important hub for fishing, trade, and tourism. The city has a long history dating back to Phoenician times when it was known as Antaradus.

## Tartus Cathedral

The Tartus Cathedral, originally the Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa, is a Crusader-era church that has since been converted into a museum. Built in the 12th century, it was one of the best-preserved Crusader churches in the Levant. Today, it houses historical and archaeological exhibits.

## Coastal Charm

Tartus is known for its relaxed atmosphere, beaches, and proximity to Arwad Island â€” Syria's only inhabited island, rich with Phoenician and medieval heritage.
